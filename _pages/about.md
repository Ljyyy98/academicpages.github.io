I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago under the supervision of Professor [Frank Calegari](https://math.uchicago.edu/~fcale/). My research is in the area of algebraic number theory, especially the computation of deformation rings. I am on the job market this year. Here is my [CV](/_pages/Jinyue Luo - CV.pdf).
